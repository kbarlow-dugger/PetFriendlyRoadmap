  <h1>Game Week Prep Information Page</h1>
  <img src="https://duggerpawcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sports-analytics-photo-card.png" height="200" align="right" hspace="15"><p>There are 3 plays simulated at the moment. They are:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Q1(4:32)</strong> Tannehill pass to Okonkwo (2nd longest play)</li>
  <li><strong>Q1(5:13)</strong> Tannehill short pass to Henry (3rd longest)</li>
  <li><strong>Q2(7:46)</strong> TD pass to Okwonko (look for “TD” in list)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>Just click on the bar to the right of the play info - and the simulated animation of that play will appear in this window.</p>
<p>For the overall report, I am using 2022 data that was made available by the NFL for the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl. The player tracking data for 2022, however, is focused on tackles, not the entire play. Thus, while I can generate animations for each of the plays easily, it doesn't give a complete enough
view of the entire play. And I couldn't find a great source online.</p>
<p>Thus, I decided to use a few sample plays from the 2021 NFL Big Data content (2018 play data), because the plays are complete. And, of course, I would just analyze plays from that contest, but no, the plays included for that contest are all pass plays. Thus, it 
doesn't provide a great Game Prep exercise if you're just looking at one type of plays.</p>
